About
---

[`williamfan2029.github.io/stoppoverty`](stoppoverty.github.io "This is the website you are viewing right now") is created by Avenues Shenzhen students working to campaign for no poverty.

We made this website to let you donate easier and also campaign for #StopPoverty.

For example, did you know that more than **a billion people** earn ***less than a dollar*** each day?

Or that you only need to spend **$6 each month** to feed a child?

We used GitHub Pages to publish our website; hope you like it and have a nice day!
